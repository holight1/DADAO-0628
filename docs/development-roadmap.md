# Development Roadmap

## M0: Reproducible Foundation

- Repository checks run on a clean host or development container.
- SPEC and component commits are locked.
- Independent instruction vectors have a documented schema.

## M1: MC and CPU Core

- QEMU executes hand-encoded scalar programs in MMU-off bare-metal mode.
- LLVM MC assembles and disassembles the same vectors.
- Invalid encodings and immediate boundaries are rejected consistently.

## M2: Basic CodeGen

- LLVM lowers scalar integer and pointer functions to verified instructions.
- Load/store, branch, direct call, return, frame, and spill paths execute.
- The object ABI needed by this milestone is written and tested.

## M2 status + sequencing decision (2026-07-12)

M2 basic CodeGen is done and extended well past the original scope: integer
arithmetic (add/sub/mul/div/rem/shift), all comparison predicates, control flow
(branches/loops/if-else), select→cs* (branchless), function calls (calling conv,
callee-save, nested, RAS), stack arrays, globals via standard lld linking,
sub-i64 types (i8/i16/i32 narrow ld/st + sign/zero extend), global address as a
value (arrays/strings/address-of-global). In flight: function-pointer indirect
call (DL-063b, CALL_RRII).

**Next milestone = clang integration (real-C frontend), not more aggregate
CodeGen.** Decision (2026-07-12): after indirect call, prioritize wiring a clang
DADAO target (triple / TargetInfo / ABI / driver) over the remaining aggregate
gaps, because:
- Without clang we only feed hand-written `.ll` to `llc`; the aggregate features
  below are only *exercised* once a C frontend emits them — doing them first is
  spinning wheels.
- clang is the true bottleneck for "real C", and it also opens the
  llvm-test-suite path (ADR-0012 T3).

**memcpy/memset — two layers, don't conflate (2026-07-12):**
- The `llvm.memcpy`/`llvm.memset` **intrinsics** (emitted by clang for
  struct-by-value copy and aggregate init) are lowered by the **backend**:
  inline-expand small constant sizes into load/store (set MaxStoresPerMem*),
  no libc needed. Deferred — done alongside aggregates once clang emits them.
- The libc `memcpy`/`memset` **symbols** (the large/variable-size libcall
  fallback) belong to **musl** (libc milestone), not the backend.

Deferred until clang: aggregate/struct-by-value handling, struct return
(sret/multi-reg), `llvm.mem*` intrinsic inline-expansion.

**Function-pointer indirect call — deferred (2026-07-12, decision C).** Three
rounds (DL-063b×2, DL-063c debug) did not crack it: the indirect path crashes in
the scheduler (`ScheduleDAGSDNodes::BuildSchedUnits`, getValueType "Illegal
result number"). Structural root cause: CALL_INDIRECT_PSEUDO is built by hand via
DAGToDAG `getMachineNode` (unlike RET_PSEUDO which is pattern-selected), and the
`Select()` override intercepts every `DADAOISD::CALL` before `SelectCode`, so a
tablegen pattern can't take over (attempts gave "Node already inserted"). The
fix is to go pure pattern-based like RISC-V `PseudoCALLIndirect` (remove the
manual CALL interception), but after three rounds the ROI dropped, so per
decision C we pivot to clang first and revisit indirect call later. WIP is
`git stash`ed in `.work/llvm` (stash@{0}); the root-cause analysis is preserved
in the DL-063c task. Committed patch series stops at 0019 (clean, no broken
0020); lit 24/24.

## Deferred Milestones

- clang DADAO frontend (triple/TargetInfo/ABI/driver) — next milestone.
- Complete ABI and runtime.
- System QEMU, exception model, and MMU.
- Static userspace and libc (musl port; provides memcpy/memset/... symbols).
- llvm-test-suite (gated on clang + musl; ADR-0012 T3).
- Kernel bring-up.
- Dynamic linking, TLS, signals, atomics, and SMP.
