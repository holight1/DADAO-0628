# Development Roadmap

## M0: Reproducible Foundation

- Repository checks run on a clean host or development container.
- SPEC and component commits are locked.
- Independent instruction vectors have a documented schema.

## M1: MC and CPU Core

- QEMU executes hand-encoded scalar programs in MMU-off bare-metal mode.
- LLVM MC assembles and disassembles the same vectors.
- Invalid encodings and immediate boundaries are rejected consistently.

## M2: Basic CodeGen

- LLVM lowers scalar integer and pointer functions to verified instructions.
- Load/store, branch, direct call, return, frame, and spill paths execute.
- The object ABI needed by this milestone is written and tested.

## Deferred Milestones

- Complete ABI and runtime.
- System QEMU, exception model, and MMU.
- Static userspace and libc.
- Kernel bring-up.
- Dynamic linking, TLS, signals, atomics, and SMP.
